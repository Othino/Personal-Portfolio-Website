# Personal Portfolio

## MICAH OTHINO Portfolio Website

### Introduction:

Welcome to my personal portfolio website project! This project was created as part of my journey towards my `Full-Stack` software development journey and to showcase my projects to potential employers. The website serves as an introduction to myself and my work, including links to my `GitHub`, `LinkedIn`, and other blog posts. It was developed using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, and is deployed using `Netlify` and `GitHub Pages`. You can access the deployed site here: Link to deployed site

### Inspiration:

The inspiration for this project came from my desire to create a central hub for my work as a web developer. Prior to this project, my projects were scattered across various platforms and it was difficult to showcase my skills and growth over time. I wanted to create a visually appealing and professional website that would allow me to showcase my skills, experience, and projects in one place.

### Technical Challenge:

The biggest technical challenge I faced with this project was creating a responsive design that would work on multiple screen sizes. Initially, I created the website using a fixed-width layout, but quickly realized that this would not work for users accessing the site on smaller screens. I had to learn about responsive design and implement media queries to ensure that the website would be accessible on any screen size. This involved a lot of trial and error and required me to adjust the layout and positioning of various elements on the page.
Another challenge was integrating the EmailJs for the contact section which was very hideous to make it responsive.

### Future Iterations:

In the future, I plan to add more projects to the website, change the contact sectiuon, add a landing page that would redirect to several sections such as skills, education and, experience and also improve the design to make it more visually appealing. I also plan to incorporate more dynamic features, such as animations and interactive elements, to make the website more engaging for visitors. Additionally, I would like to explore using a CSS framework, such as Bootstrap or Foundation, to streamline the design process and ensure cross-browser compatibility.
